Hello, my name is Edilson Rodrigues and I'm a developer. I love programming and have experience with several programming languages and frameworks, but my favorite is Dart and Flutter 😍. Currently, I work at [CI&T](https://ciandt.com/), where I apply my skills and work on challenging projects 🔭.

I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn 🌱 because I believe it's essential to evolve in my career and stay up-to-date with technology. My goal is to use my skills to positively impact people's lives ✨.

- 🆙 Technical skills

**Dart and Flutter**: I have extensive practical experience with these technologies, having worked on several personal and professional projects using them. In particular, I have worked on large-scale projects using these technologies, which has allowed me to improve my mobile development skills.

**React**: I have professional experience with React in projects for financial companies, which has provided me with a deeper understanding of web development. Additionally, I also have knowledge of Apollo, a library that allows integration of React with GraphQL, which has proven to be quite useful in more complex projects.

**Other technologies**: I also have knowledge of TypeScript, JavaScript, GCP, AppScript, DataStudio, BigQuery, Firebase, PHP, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, which I have acquired through online courses and personal and professional projects.

- 🆙 Tracks and courses

**Bootcamp The App Brewery - The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart**. This course provided more than 23 hours of learning content that helped me build my programming knowledge while developing real-world applications using Flutter and Dart technologies. The instructor was Angela Yu.

**Course The Ultimate Redux Course**, with instructor Mosh.

I participated in the **Next Level Week** tracks by Rocketseat starting from the second edition, learning **ReactJs** and, in the latest edition, updating my knowledge in **Flutter**.
